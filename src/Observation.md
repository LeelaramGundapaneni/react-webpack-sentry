# 🛠️ Sentry Integration Project

This project is a fork from the
[Sentry documentation example](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/integrate-frontend/create-new-project/).
It demonstrates how to integrate Sentry into a frontend project, with some
observations and issues encountered along the way.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Forked the Project**: Created a fork from the original project.
2. **Created a New Project & Team**: Set up a new Sentry project and created a
   team to manage it.

## 🧪 To-Do & Experiments

### Browser Client

- 🔍 **Investigate Client Behavior**:
  - The hub is in a separate package (`@sentry/hub`).
  - ⚠️ **Issue**: Automatic error capturing is not happening with the hub.
  - ❌ **Issue**: Unable to initialize Sentry at the top level with the hub.
- 🛠️ **Testing Error Capture**:
  - Threw a normal error to see how Sentry captures it.
  - 🚫 **Observation**: Errors are not captured via the hub but are captured
    with `sentry.init`.

## 🔍 Observations

- 🛠️ **Sourcemaps Issue**: When building or starting the project, the source
  maps don't show the expected artifacts(`showing zero artifacts) via webpack
  sentry plugin.
